In the last lesson,
You saw that a few errors are occurring in your code.



Let's try to understand and resolve them.

I would recommend you to start solving errors from `main.cpp` file.



What do you think, 

why are the errors occurring here?



Look at the part of the error to know it.

Do you get something?



Okay, let me give you a hint.

Does `main.cpp` know that some class with the name `Player` exists in this world?



Got it? I guess so.

So now, what would you do?

Yes, you will include the file which consists `Player` class in `main.cpp`.



In the previous lesson, you declared `Player` class in `Player.hpp` file,

so, just include that in `main.cpp`



main.cpp```cpp
#include "Player.hpp"
#include "PokemonChoice.hpp"
#include "PokemonType.hpp"
#include "Utility.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <limits> // Include this header to use numeric_limits
#include <string>

....
....
....

```





This will resolve a few errors now that you have included `Player.hpp` in `main.cpp` 

But a few new ones will come up as well.

Don’t worry. This is what debugging feels like.



It's a process of cleaning up your code.

And as you keep on fixing one issue after another, 

your code keeps getting better and better.





Now, if you scroll down to your main function, 

you will be able to see this particular error: 

”no matching constructor for initialization of ‘`Player`’”

![error](//outscal.github.io/Full-Stack-Game-Development/images/52e7c1a9d5fc09d7.png)





Why do you think the compiler is throwing this error?



*Professor Oak:* “Well, it says no constructor is declared for Player that matches the given signature!”



But we already have declared a constructor in `Player.hpp` which takes a string and a Pokemon object as arguments! Then why is it throwing an error like that?



*Professor Oak:* “Hmmm… Maybe it has something to do with the arguments?”



Absolutely correct! But what?



*Professor Oak:* “Ohh, I don't know, all this debugging has got my head spinning. I feel like I am going to faint, just like a Pokemon in battle!”



Okay, answer some of my questions.



In which line have you included the `Player.hpp` inside `main.cpp`?

*Oak:* Line number 1 ! At the top of my code!



Which class is the Player’s constructor dependent on?

*Oak:* The Pokemon class



What comes first in sequence inside `main.cpp` → Player or Pokemon?

*Oak:* Well, we have included the `Player` class at the top, so Player comes first, and then the Pokemon class is defined below



So, the compiler does not know what Pokemon is when `Player's` constructor is being declared.

*Professor Oak:* “Oh, I see where you are getting at. Do you mean to say we should include `Player.hpp` after the `Pokemon` class is defined in `main.cpp` file?”



Correct! Go ahead and try to include `Player.hpp` after the definition of `Pokemon` class. 





Your code should look like this below:



main.cpp```cpp
#include "PokemonChoice.hpp"
#include "PokemonType.hpp"
#include "Utility.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <limits> // Include this header to use numeric_limits
