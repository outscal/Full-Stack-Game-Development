# Problem Statement -


---

There are `n` people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the `0th` person is at the **front** of the line and the `(n - 1)th` person is at the **back** of the line.

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `tickets` of length `n` where the number of tickets that the `ith` person would like to buy is `tickets[i]`.

Each person takes **exactly 1 second** to buy a ticket. A person can only buy **1 ticket at a time** and has to go back to **the end** of the line (which happens **instantaneously**) in order to buy more tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will **leave** the line.

**Return *****the time taken for the person at position***** **`**k**`** *****(0-indexed)***** *****to finish buying tickets*****.**



Example 1:

**Input** - `tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2`

**Output **- `ans = 6`

**Explanation **-

- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes `[1, 2, 1]` Time passed in the first pass = 3
- In the second pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes `[0, 1, 0]` Time passed till now = 6. And since person at position 2 has no tickets to buy now

Therefore the answer is 6



Example 2:

**Input **- `tickets = [5,1,1,1], k = 0`

**Output **- `ans = 8`

**Explanation **-

- In the first pass, everyone in the line buys a ticket and the line becomes `[4, 0, 0, 0]` Time passed till here is 4.
- In the next 4 passes, only the person in position 0 is buying tickets because all other people have already bought their required number of tickets.

The person at position 0 has successfully bought 5 tickets it took him 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 seconds



# Constraints -


---

- `n == tickets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= tickets[i] <= 100`
- `0 <= k < n`
